# experiment
## really bad
### lots of security issues
# *WILL NOT FIX LOL*

simple website which allows users to access a database which is stored in a map inside the code\
has simple login which redirects to search page (page.html) or a login failed page (failed.html)\
has simple search function which lists out all the results using the tags in the database\

security issues:\
literally can type a search query url and bypass the password input LOL
